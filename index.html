            I hate the St. George heat, its fall it's suppose to be COLD and CHILLY. It doesn't feel
            like fall at all, I keeping thinking about last year when it ACTUALLY felt like fall and it makes me sad.
            I just want to be able to go outside without feeling miserable, I want to enjoy the cool winds and have a nice walk
            but it still feels like summer and I sweat instantly... I yearn for happiness but the sun robs me of that
            happiness unobtainable until we nuke the sun and we can finally feel the cold again.
            or alternativaly we could all go in cryostasis chambers and be at peace.
